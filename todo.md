# Before publish

## Fun ideas 

- [x] make class for Task-Collection to improve encapsulation [2022-09-22 20:37] [2022-09-22 20:38]
- [x] create shortcuts to toggle state between done and todo
- [x] add timetable task to hover when on title
- [x] create .md report with daily steps
- [x] indicate duration on attachment in case of timestamps
- [x] hide status timer when not active
- [x] cycle todo status
- [x] add total sum to each table

## bugs

- [x] duration rounding
- [x] report creation when task is active
- [x] sorting for report by date not working
- [x] shortcut for timer toggle is bad
- [x] when timer is active there -> hover at start toggle shows one entry only 

## Not so fun work

- [ ] make readme
  - [x] create icon
  - [ ] explain usage

# After publish

- [ ] csv export?
