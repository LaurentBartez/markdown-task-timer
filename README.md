# markdown-todo-timer README

Inspired from the emacs org-mode clocking feature I created this vs-code extension.  

The intention is to have a similar functionality for todo-lists based on markdown syntax. 

**Currently this project is not released to the marketplace as I just started the development.**
## Features

- add timestamps to todo-tasks. The timestamp format is [YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm].
- indicate active tasks in editor
- show timer in status bar whenever there is an active task

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following commands:

* `markdown-todo-timer.toggleTimer (ctrl+shift+c)`: Toggles the timer. Active tasks will be set inactive. If there is no active tasks, the selected task will be toggled to active 
* `markdown-todo-timer.toggleStatus (ctrl+shift+enter)`: Toggles the task status between done and inwork 

## Known Issues

## Release Notes
